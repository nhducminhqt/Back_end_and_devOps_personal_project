This is my personal project using:
  + FastAPI for service_a
  + rGPR for service_b
  + Miniconda and Docker
  + MongoDB
This repository contains a Python-based back-end application using FastAPI and gRPC for image processing services. The project demonstrates integration between two services (Service A and Service B), which communicate via gRPC to process images and store data in MongoDB.
